* Displays current status (blue, grey, red) circles
* Displays time remaining to build
* Upon pressing Stream Deck button, triggers a build

WARNING: this plugin is for personal use. Whilst it works well for me, and I hope it will serve as a useful base for others, it relies on a particular Jenkins HTML output. It will likely break easily.

## Installation

Download the ZIP from GitHub. Rename the .zip to .streamDeckPlugin. Double click to install
