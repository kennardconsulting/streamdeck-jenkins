Jenkins Plugin for Stream Deck

WARNING: this plugin is for personal use. Whilst it works well for me, and I hope it will serve as a useful base for others, it relies on a particular Jenkins HTML output. It will likely break easily.

## Installation

Download all files. ZIP them into a folder. Rename the .zip to .streamDeckPlugin. Double click to install
